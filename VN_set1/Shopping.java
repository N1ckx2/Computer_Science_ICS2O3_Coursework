/* Programmer Joke #4

So a bunch of computer geeks were in a Java lacture.  A girl was writing in 
her diary, and one of the geeks peered over her shoulder.  The girl noticed
and said, "Hey, that's private!!".  The geek was very confused, and replied
"But I thought we were in the same class!"

Ba Dum Tss!
